# WASPAS
Explanation:

- Data Preparation: Create a pandas DataFrame to store player data and assign weights to each criterion.
- Normalization: Normalize the data using min-max normalization to ensure comparability between criteria.
- Weighted Sum Calculation: Calculate the weighted sum for each player.
- Weighted Product Calculation: Calculate the weighted product for each player.
- WASPAS Score Calculation: Combine the weighted sum and weighted product using the lambda coefficient.
Ranking: Rank the players based on their WASPAS scores.


Key Points:
Weighting Coefficient (lambda): This parameter controls the relative importance of the WSM and WPM components. A higher lambda value gives more weight to the WSM.
Normalization: Normalization is crucial to ensure fair comparisons between criteria with different scales.
Criteria Selection: The choice of criteria depends on the specific needs and priorities of the football club.
Weight Assignment: Assigning appropriate weights to criteria is a subjective process that may involve expert judgment or statistical techniques.
Sensitivity Analysis: Perform sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of changes in weights or data on the final rankings.
