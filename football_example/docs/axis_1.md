You're absolutely right! In the context of multiplying a DataFrame by a Series of weights, axis=1 is the correct choice.

Here's a breakdown of why:

- axis=1: This specifies that the multiplication should be performed column-wise. Each column of the DataFrame is multiplied by the corresponding element in the Series. This is the typical operation for applying weights to different features or attributes.

- axis=2: While it's technically possible to use axis=2 in certain scenarios involving 3D arrays or higher-dimensional tensors, it's not applicable in the case of multiplying a 2D DataFrame by a 1D Series.




In essence, axis=1 is the standard approach for applying weights to a DataFrame, ensuring that each feature is scaled or multiplied by its respective weight.

By understanding the concept of axes in Pandas, you can effectively manipulate and analyze data in various ways, including applying weights to specific columns or rows.
