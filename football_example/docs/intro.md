Explanation:

Data Preparation: Create a DataFrame to store player data and assign weights to each criterion.
Normalization: If necessary, normalize the data to ensure fair comparisons between criteria with different scales.
Weighted Sum Calculation: Calculate the weighted sum for each player by multiplying each criterion's value by its corresponding weight and summing the results.
Ranking: Sort the DataFrame by the weighted score to rank the players.
Additional Considerations:

More Complex MCDA Methods: For more sophisticated decision-making, consider using methods like Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) or Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS).
Data Quality: Ensure the quality and reliability of the data used in the analysis.
Subjective Factors: Incorporate subjective factors, such as a player's potential, team chemistry, and manager's preferences, into the decision-making process.
Sensitivity Analysis: Perform sensitivity analysis to assess how changes in weights or data affect the final ranking.
